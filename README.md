## ‚ú® Features & Modules

NativeShield provides multiple protection layers to secure your Android application:

### üîç **Debugger Detection**
- Detects whether a debugger is attached to the app process
- Monitors common debugging techniques and tools
- Real-time detection with configurable response actions

### üï∑Ô∏è **Frida Detection**
- Blocks Frida server & gadget attempts at runtime instrumentation
- Detects Frida-related processes and libraries
- Prevents dynamic analysis and code injection

### üß¨ **Riru & Zygisk Detection**
- Identifies hooking frameworks injected into the Android runtime
- Detects Xposed-based modules and LSPosed
- Monitors system-level modifications

### üì± **Root Detection**
- Finds traces of root binaries, `su`, and common rooting tools
- Checks for SuperSU, Magisk, and other root management apps
- Validates system integrity and permissions

### üßæ **Memory Access & Dump Detection**
- Prevents `/proc/self/mem` reads and unauthorized memory access
- Blocks ptrace attachments and memory dump tools
- Protects sensitive data in memory

### üß© **Library Patch & Hook Detection**
- Detects tampering or hooking attempts on native shared libraries
- Monitors library integrity and modification attempts
- Prevents runtime patching and code injection

## üìã TODO

- [ ] üìñ **Better documentation** (in-code comments & comprehensive README)
- [ ] üõ°Ô∏è **App Tamper Detection** (APK signature validation, checksum verification, etc.)
- [ ] üß© **Magisk-Hide Detection Module** (e.g. Shamiko detection)
- [ ] üìú **Blacklist system** for AntiLibPatch module

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### AndroidManifest.xml Configuration

**Critical:** Add the following attribute to your `AndroidManifest.xml` for proper functionality:

```xml
<application
    android:name=".MainActivity"
    android:extractNativeLibs="true"
    android:allowBackup="false"
    android:debuggable="false"
    ... >
    
    <!-- Your activities and other components -->
    
</application>
```

This attribute is **required** for the `AntiLibPatch` module to function correctly.
